There might be a typo in the email address provided\n\nTo proceed with processing the expense claim, we'll need to correctly identify Anya in our system. Here are a few options:\n\n1.

If she's a new employee, she might need to be added to the system first before we can process her expense claim\n\nWould you like to try searching with different information, or would you prefer to hold off on processing this expense claim until we can properly identify Anya in the system?"
